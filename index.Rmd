# Prerequisites

Make sure that you have a signed contract. Even though some lessons are useful in general, it is best if you have full access to the microdata resources (e.g. server, slack, github, etc.) first. To gain access to every resource, you need a CEU-issued e-mail address, which you should receive shortly after signing your contract.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
